# covid-19-explore

In this project, I have created interactive visualizations on Flex Dashboard and I've used the COVID-19 Deaths dataset from Kaggle.

About COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations

This dataset contains two files that provide detailed information on Covid-19 deaths and vaccinations worldwide. The first file contains data on the number of Covid-19 deaths, including total deaths and new deaths, across different locations and time periods.

The second file contains data on Covid-19 vaccinations, including total vaccinations, people vaccinated, people fully vaccinated, and total boosters, across different locations and time periods. By analyzing this data, you can uncover insights into the global impact of Covid-19 and explore the relationship between vaccinations and deaths.

This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers, data analysts, and anyone interested in understanding the ongoing pandemic.
